        <p>Chinese Downhill is a reference to a scene in the movie Hot Dog where a group of skiers setup a competition to see who is the best by skiing down expert terrain and first one to the bottom wins. No rules. Anything goes.</p>
        <p>This spirit of competition and joy of skiing is at the heart of what the Chinese Downhill Band stands for. The band is based out of Breckenridge, Colorado. And our motto is we are “a band by skiers for skiers.” But what does that actually mean?</p>
        <p>First of all, at our core, we are skiers. Lead singer Dylan Walczyk skis for Team USA and knows he way around on a pair of skis. Bass player Michael Schaefer is an Alpine II certified instructor and teaches skiing at Breckenridge resort. In fact, all the members of the band ski or ride with a high degree of competency.</p>
        <p>But in a ski town, just about everybody skis. What makes Chinese Downhill special is the music. Michael and Dylan met each other at the RMU Open Mic on Wednesday nights. Michael was the host of the event. And Dylan was just a guy that showed up dragging his massive Vox AC30 up on stage and singing Clash tunes as a solo artist. Didn’t take long, and Michael was sitting in on bass, and the two struck up a musical friendship.</p>
        <p>Dylan was the one who first came up with the idea of playing a certain style of music … skier music. And who would know better what skiers want to hear than someone who travels the globe skiing professionally? So it was Dylan who proposed the idea for the music … let’s play the music from our favorite ski movies. Movies like: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nud0BUxf3lI">Ready Fire Aim</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muP9Q3tM6QE">Not Another Ski Movie</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJwmq1OO1VI">GNAR</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKVQ5pugma0">Magma</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGP3nKk3-Dc">Attack of La Nina</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfd5ZfaTS4c">The Way I See It</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlU5v694CKI">Claim</a>, etc.</p>
        <p>This means, you’re gonna hear a lot of Clash tunes at our shows. We also love to bring some roots music into our sets like reggae and ska because we feel this also creates a vibe that skiers that live in the mountains want to hear. Come to a show and you’re gonna hear The Clash, Joe Strummer, Peter Tosh, UB 40, Elvis Costello, The Jam, Jimmy Cliff, Toots and the Maytals, Pulp, Talking Heads, Billy Idol, stuff like that. But one thing you can count on … it’s gonna be a good time, one that you’ll remember for years to come.</p>
